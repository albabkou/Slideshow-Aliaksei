	<div class="container-element">African Wildlife is diverse and wealthy. No other continent matches the wealth of wildlife found in Africa covering the full climatic spectrum from intense heat to bitter cold. Its varied vegetation has given rise to a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects. Among them are more than 40 species of primate, ranging from tiny galagos to huge gorillas, a great variety of antelopes, gazelles and other hoofed animals and 70 species of carnivore. Bird life, too, is extraordinarily rich. More than 1,500 species live south of the Sahara. In addition Africa is inhabited by: the worldâ€™s fastest land animal the cheetah, the biggest bird the ostrich and the largest land animal the elephant. </div>
